# Card_Shuffle_Prediction
Course Project for ESTR2018 (collaborated with Yu Chao)

In many strategy-based games, a randomizer is often needed in order to keep matches independent from previous ones. A good example is poker. If the games are run by a computer, they have access to a built-in RNG that usually does the job. However, in real-life scenario, we do not have such luxury and often need to resort to some tricks. In this project, we will look into two most prominent and frequently-used techniques, overhand shuffle and riffle shuffle, for introducing randomness into poker deck. The shuffling techniques are  first modeled in Python programs, and their effectiveness will be evaluated by mathematical models. In addition, we also looked into some strategies for card-guessing given that the way of shuffling is known through simulations. The results of the simulations will be presented.

Before we dive into the specific domains of overhand shuffle and riffle, we will first discuss some general topics of card shuffling, which would prove useful later on.
